        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cup hung curd</li>
            <li>1/2 cup ghee</li>
            <li>3 cup sugar</li>
            <li>5 strand saffron</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon powdered green cardamom</li>
            <li>1/2 cup corn flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pinch baking soda</li>
            <li>2 cup sunflower oil</li>
            <li>3 cup water</li>
            <li>4 drops rose essence</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon edible food color</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Method -->
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the sugar syrup, heat water in a pan over medium flame. </li>
            <li>Add sugar and mix until fully dissolved. Simmer the syrup until it attains one-string consistency.</li>
            <li>Add saffron, cardamom powder and rose essence.</li>
            <li>Stir well to prepare the final sugar syrup.</li>
            <li>This will be used to soak the jalebis and give them their signature sweetness.</li>
            <li>Now, heat oil in a pan over medium flame for deep frying.</li>
            <li>Fill the jalebi batter in a muslin cloth and pierce a small hole in the cloth. </li>
            <li>You can even use a squeezy bottle (ketchup bottles with a small nozzle on top) to make jalebis.</li>
            <li>Now just squeeze the muslin cloth to make concentric circles.</li>
            <li>Move from inside to outside to make perfect circles.</li>
            <li>Fry till jalebis from both the sides until they are crispy in texture and golden in colour.</li>
            <li>Soak the jalebis in sugar syrup for 3-4 minutes in warm sugar syrup.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the sugar syrup is warm and not very hot, as this will make the jalebis limp.</li>
            <li>Don't soak the jalebis for too long if you wish to retain their crispiness.</li>
            <li>Now, remove the jalebis from the syrup and place it on a tray lined with butter paper or foil.</li>
            <li>Decorate with silver foil (optional) and serve the jalebis hot, warm or at room temperature with creamy Rabri. </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The most important part of making Jalebi at home is to have the right consistency of your Jalebi batter. <br> It should not be too thin or thick. Make sure your batter is of flowing consistency</li>
            <li>Traditionally, the Jalebi batter is fermented for 10-12 hours in warmth. <br> But, if you live in a cold place, you must ferment it for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>While frying the Jalebis, make sure the flame is on low. <br> High heat will leave it uncooked from the inside. This will also give you ample time to give your Jalebis the best shape.</li>
            <li>For Instant Jalebis, mix together all-purpose flour, corn flour, and a little turmeric. <br> Then, add curd and water to it and whisk well in one direction to make a smooth batter.</li>
        </ul>
